### Analysis Summary

I couldn't find any direct matches for "cliente", "client", "customer", or "user" in the codebase. This could mean a few things:

1.  **Different Terminology:** The codebase might use different terms for client-related entities (e.g., "account", "member", "guest").
2.  **Obfuscation/Abstraction:** Client information might be heavily abstracted or handled by external services, with only internal IDs or references present in the code.
3.  **Limited Scope:** The current search might be too broad or too narrow.

To help me understand what you're looking for, could you please clarify your query? For example:

*   Are you looking for code related to **user authentication or authorization**?
*   Are you interested in **data structures** that store client information?
*   Are you trying to find **API endpoints** that handle client requests?
*   Do you have a specific **file or module** in mind where you expect to find client-related code?

The more context you provide, the better I can assist you.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Understanding the Initial Search Results and Limitations**
   The initial search for terms like "cliente", "client", "customer", or "user" did not yield direct matches. This suggests that the system might use different terminology, abstract client information, or handle it via external services. To provide a more accurate response, further clarification is needed regarding the specific aspect of client-related code the user is interested in.
